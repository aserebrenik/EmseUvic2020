## Preclass Homework

Write a blogpost on the preworkshop assigned materials in advance of the lecture 
(to be completed by 6pm the day before the workshop --> Thursday).
Your blogpost should include at most one discussion question per assigned reading/video/podcast.

Copy these questions to the relevant Slack channel and like other questions you think should be asked of our guests (we can't ask all of them!). 
The course staff will curate/group them on Thursday evening starting at 6pm. 
You may (and are encouraged to) update your blogpost after the workshop (but in a separate section of the post). 
The final version of your blogpost (if you improve it) is due by the following Monday at 6pm.
